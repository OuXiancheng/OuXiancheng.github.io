<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Ming Li is currently a ''Shuang Long Scholar'' Distinguished Professor at the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Education Technology and Application of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Normal University, China.</p>
<p>He received his PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology at La Trobe University, Australia. He completed two Postdoctoral Fellowship positions with the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, La Trobe University, Australia, and the Department of Information Technology in Education, South China Normal University, China, respectively.</p>
<p>He has published in top-tier journals and conferences, including IEEE TPAMI, Artificial Intelligence, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TII, IEEE TITS, ACM TMOS, Neural Networks, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR. 
<p>He is a member of IEEE, a member of China Computer Federation (CCF), a member of Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI), and an accredited member of Australian Mathematical Society (AustMS).</p>
<p>He is a regular reviewer and has reviewed more than 300 papers for top journals, including IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TKDE, Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, Information Sciences, Neurocomputing, etc..</p> 
<p>He, as a leading guest editor, organizes a special issue on “Deep Neural Networks for Graphs: Theory, Models, Algorithms and Applications” in IEEE TNNLS, a special session on "Recent Advances in Deep Learning for Graphs" in the 8th International Online & Onsite Conference on Machine Learning, Optimization, and Data Science (LOD2022).</p> 
<p>He is a PC member at top conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, WSDM, ICME, AJCAI, etc.. He is an Associate Editor of Neural Networks.</p>
<p>I am looking for highly-motivated students to work with me on the exciting area of graph neural networks, graph representation learning, geometric deep learning, etc.</p>


<h2>News </h2>
<ul>

<li><p>Our work "Are graph convolutional networks with random weights feasible?" is published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></li>

<li><p>Our work "Multi-View graph convolutional networks with attention mechanism" is published in Artificial Intelligence (Elsevier)</p></li>

<li><p>12/2021: We have a new paper accepted at AAAI 2022 which is the first work that studies the best-of-both-worlds problem in online learning to rank, under the position-based model.</p></li>

<li><p>09/2021: Two papers are accepted at NeurIPS. One talks about a new graph quantity that could be more tight for graph bandits with weakly observable graphs. And the other one gives the first positive result for Thompson sampling algorithm in combinatorial bandits with approximation (greedy) oracle.</p></li>

<li><p>04/2021: We have a new paper accepted in SIGIR 2021. The work improves the current bandit algorithm for conversational recommendation system by considering comparison feedback.</p></li>

<li><p>09/2020: We have a new paper accepted in NeurIPS 2020. The work provides the first regret bound on online influence maximization under linear threshold model.</p></li>
